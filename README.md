# SQLite

**SQLite is a lightweight relational database management system (RDBMS) that is embedded directly into the Android operating system. It allows Android developers to store and manage structured data in a private database, typically within the context of their own application.**

Here are some key features of SQLite databases in Android:

* **Embedded Database:** SQLite is embedded into Android, meaning that it doesn't run as a separate process. Instead, it operates within the same process space as the Android application that uses it.

* **SQL Support:** SQLite databases in Android support standard SQL syntax for creating, querying, updating, and deleting data. This makes it familiar to developers who have experience with SQL-based databases.

* **Lightweight:** SQLite is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for use in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices.

* **Transactional:** SQLite supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

* **Security:** SQLite databases in Android are private to each application by default, providing a level of security and isolation for the data stored within them.

* **Integration with Android APIs:** Android provides a set of APIs for interacting with SQLite databases, including classes like SQLiteOpenHelper and SQLiteDatabase, which simplify common database operations such as creating tables, executing SQL commands, and managing database connections.

Overall, SQLite databases in Android provide a convenient and efficient way for developers to persistently store and manage structured data within their applications. They are commonly used for storing user preferences, application settings, cached data, and other types of structured data
